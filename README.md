# Youtubedownloader

# Note
This is my first full python script I(Sky) am bound to mess up somewhere or do practices that are bad so if you're better at python go ahead to contribute(look below for information)

## Installing(Windows Only)
- Go over to releases and install the zip file

### NOTE
Do not remove the exe from the folder unless you want it to create the Videos/Playlists/Audio folders in another folder

Follow the steps in the Contributing section without doing the last step

## Contributing

## TODO
- Allow to download more than one video/playlist at a time
- Playlist audio only downloading
- Use GUI instead of CLI

- Remove the temp files once folder is being used in Audio, Videos, and Playlists
