# Youtubedownloader

# Note
This is my first full python script I(Sky) am bound to mess up somewhere or do practices that are bad so if you're better at python go ahead to contribute(look below for information)

## Installing(Windows Only)
Go over to releases and install the zip

## Contributing
- Download a copy of the main branch
- Create a virtual enviornment called 'downloader' as its in the .gitignore file
- Activate the enviornment
- install the requirements.txt by 'pip install -r requirements.txt'(coming in next commit)
- Submit a pull request

## TODO
- Make it Mac/Linux compatible
- Use GUI instead of CLI
- Add animated download bars
- Use my own package for downloading instead of [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)
