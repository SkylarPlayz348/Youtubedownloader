# Youtubedownloader

# Note
This is my first full python script I(Sky) am bound to mess up somewhere or do practices that are bad so if you're better at python go ahead to contribute(look below for information)

## Installing
Go over to releases and install the source code(still getting the hang of the whole release thing so give me two or three releases)
## Contributing
- Download a copy of the main branch
- Create a virtual enviornment called 'downloader' as its in the .gitignore file
- Activate the enviornment
- install the requirements.txt by 'pip install -r requirements.txt'(coming in next commit)
- Submit a pull request
